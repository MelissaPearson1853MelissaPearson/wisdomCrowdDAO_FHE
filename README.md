# WisdomCrowdDAO_FHE: Harnessing Collective Intelligence with Privacy

WisdomCrowdDAO_FHE is an innovative governance framework powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. Designed for complex decision-making, this decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) leverages the "wisdom of the crowd" to help teams and communities arrive at optimal collective decisions. Utilizing homomorphic encryption, it ensures that privacy is maintained while effectively aggregating the insights and judgments of all members involved.

## The Challenge of Complex Decision-Making

In the ever-evolving landscape of decentralized governance, groups often face intricate decisions without clear answers—like which strategic direction to pursue next. Traditional voting methods may lead to suboptimal outcomes as they don't tap into the deeper insights that each member can provide. Furthermore, concerns regarding the privacy of individual opinions can inhibit honest and open communication among DAO members, leading to a lack of trust and engagement.

## The FHE-Powered Solution

WisdomCrowdDAO_FHE addresses these challenges by employing **Fully Homomorphic Encryption** to create a secure, privacy-preserving platform where members can share opinions and reasoning anonymously. This approach allows for an iterative, Delphi-like process of input collection, where contributions are aggregated homomorphically. The outcome is a robust, high-quality decision that reflects the collective wisdom of the group while ensuring that individual contributions remain confidential. The implementation is made possible through Zama's open-source libraries, including **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, facilitating seamless integration of encryption into the DAO framework.

## Core Features

- **Privacy-Preserving Input Collection:** Members can submit their judgments anonymously through multiple rounds without exposing their identities or opinions.
- **Homomorphic Aggregation:** Decisions are made using encrypted data, allowing for the collective aggregation of insights without compromising privacy.
- **Visual Dashboard:** An intuitive interface that displays aggregated results, providing users with meaningful insights while keeping individual inputs confidential.
- **Iterative Decision-Making Process:** Leveraging a Delphi-like approach, the framework allows members to refine their opinions based on anonymous feedback, leading to more informed decision-making.
- **Holistic Governance Framework:** Beyond simple voting, it empowers organizations to utilize collective intelligence for high-quality decisions in a secure environment.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE Libraries:** Zama's **Concrete** and **zama-fhe SDK** for fully homomorphic encryption.
- **Smart Contracts Framework:** Solidity for implementing smart contracts on the blockchain.
- **Development Environment:** Node.js and Hardhat for building and testing the smart contracts.
- **Frontend Technologies:** React for building the user interface, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Directory Structure

Here's a general overview of the project's folder structure:

```
WisdomCrowdDAO_FHE/
├── contracts/
│   └── wisdomCrowdDAO_FHE.sol
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   │   └── App.js
│   ├── public/
│   └── package.json
├── scripts/

```

## Installation Instructions

To set up the WisdomCrowdDAO_FHE framework, follow these steps assuming you have already downloaded the project:

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** and **Hardhat** installed on your machine.
2. Change into the project directory using your terminal.
3. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies, including Zama's FHE libraries:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

Please refrain from using `git clone` or accessing any URLs, as this project should be set up through your downloaded files.

## Build & Run the Project

Once the installation is complete, you can proceed to compile, test, and run the project with the following commands:

1. **Compile the Smart Contracts:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Deploy the Contracts on a Local Network:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

3. **Start the Frontend Application:**

   Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

This will start the development server, and you can access the WisdomCrowdDAO_FHE dashboard in your web browser.
